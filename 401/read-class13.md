2. Given two entities, one named Player and one named Team, if you wanted to create a one to many relationship with those entities which would be the one and which would be the many?
"Team" would be the "one" side of the relationship.
"Player" would be the "many" side of the relationship.

# Baeldung: Spring Integration Testing

1. Describe the difference between a unit test and an integration test.
A unit test is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a program are tested in isolation to ensure they work correctly.  An integration test is a type of software testing that evaluates the interaction between multiple components or modules of an application to verify their combined functionality.

2. What is the object that provides support for Spring MVC Testing?
The object that provides support for Spring MVC Testing is the "MockMvc" class.

3. What does the “perform()” method do in a Spring integration test?
The perform() method is used to simulate an HTTP request to a specific endpoint or URL in your Spring MVC application. It allows you to perform actions such as sending mock requests to your controllers and capturing the resulting response.
