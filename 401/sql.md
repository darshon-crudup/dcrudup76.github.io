# Prep: Introduction to SQL

Databases are a series of tables.  Each table has different columns with unique identifiers.  The identifier allows us to filter the data. The * is a wildcard which allows you to select everything.  For example, SELECT * FROM movies; in our first lesson selects all of our movie data.  In order to filter certain results from being returned , use the WHERE clause in the query.  More complex clauses can be constructed by joining numerous AND or OR logical keywords.  Boolean logic was used throughout the different lessons.  Using DISTINCT allows you to eliminate duplicate answers.  Based on what conditions you use your output will vary.
