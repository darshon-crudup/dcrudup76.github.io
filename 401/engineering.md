## Prep: Engineering Reading

1. Whats the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

As an individual, I bring a unique combination of skills, experiences, perspectives, and personality traits that make me standout from anyone else. This uniqueness is what sets me apart and is my most valuable asset when pursuing a career and seeking potential employers. Here's a list of values I possess:

- Passion and Motivation: My passion for the work I do is the driving motivation which makes me distinct. Employers value individuals who are genuinely enthusiastic about their field and who can bring that energy and drive to their teams and projects.

- Adaptability and Resilience: My ability to adapt to different situations and bounce back from setbacks is a strength that not everyone possesses. Employers appreciate individuals who can handle change, uncertainty, and challenges with grace and resilience.

- Interpersonal Skills: My communication style, emotional intelligence, and ability to work well with others are unique to me. These interpersonal skills can contribute to building a positive and productive work environment.

- Ambition and Drive: My personal aspirations and determination to succeed can be compelling attributes. Employers value individuals who are driven to excel and continuously improve.

- Future Potential: My potential for growth and development can be a valuable long-term asset to a company. Employers may recognize my ability to evolve, learn, and take on new challenges as a key differentiator.

2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature? 

# Take a Break and Revisit Later:
When I find myself hitting a roadblock and getting frustrated, taking a break can work wonders. Stepping away from my computer, going for a walk, or simply giving myself some time to relax and clear my mind can help. Taking a break helps to reset my thought process and often leads to fresh insights when I come back to the problem later with a clearer perspective.

# Seek Help and Collaborate:
I must learn to not be afraid to seek help or collaborate with others. Reaching out to my colleagues or classmates can be very beneficial. Sometimes, discussing the problem with others can provide new ideas or alternative approaches that I may not have considered. Collaborating with teammates can also bring different skill sets and perspectives to the table, making it easier to tackle challenging problems as a group.

# Break the Problem into Smaller Parts:
Large and complex problems can be overwhelming. Breaking down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts would make things a little easier. Identifying the specific areas where I'm stuck and focusing on solving those individual components would best be handled one by one. This step-by-step approach allows me to tackle the problem systematically and make it less intimidating. As I solve each smaller part, I'll eventually gain confidence to address the more challenging aspects.
